# latincouver-2.0

This is the repo for the dynamic version of the Latincouver app.

In this version we are going to create a few things and try to decouple the api in a way that it can be integrated back with the ERP they have or it can be used as a single project to manage the mobile app data.

TODO list:
1. Rails api
2. UI for json management
3. Ionic 2.0
